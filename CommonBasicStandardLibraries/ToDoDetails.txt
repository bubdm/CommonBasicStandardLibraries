The following has to wait in order to do:

1.  The RandomExtensions (if any)
2.  The GetRandomPassword
because for now can't do because has to decide how i do the new collection classes including interfaces.
3.  ListHelpExtensions

for the groupings, if i decide to use the groupings, require some rethinking.

for the observable object, for now, won't split out the routine.

once i am ready to do a wpf application (has to be in c#), then can run some experiments.
its still early stages.


under specializedviewmodels for data entry, once i decide what custom collection i use, then will change over to that.


here are the things todo:
1.  ListHelpExtensions. (done)
won't be as many now.

2.  Double Extensions (done)

3.  Integer Extensions (done)

4.  ListProgress (done)

5.  GetRandomNumber on RandomGenerator starting at line 152.  there was some linq errors. (done) decided to do something different

we can risk not even doing the similiar names finder.
if we need it, can still do.

still; needs to check to see if there is anything that we need to recheck because of the linq problems.


was trying to decide whether to do the part for copyvs.

decided to go ahead and do that one after all.

does have more control and sometimes allowing some actual code to change

so far, finished part 1.

i have 2 more classes to do for the copying vs.


decided to wait a while before doing the xamarin forms version.
we have a long ways to go before we can even do the xamarin forms stuff anyways.

looks like i was able to do the part for converters to make more combined code.

for cases where its different, can use delegates so if (when) used, then can send to it to return the results in the format needed.
