# CommonBasicStandardLibraries
This contains all most common functions needed for C# Projects.
There are some that parts came from other open source projects like the json and the starting points for the helpers for MVVM.
Plus some came from Xamarin Forms so a person can use them without having to use the entire xamarin forms which is good for windows wpf
projects.  Also, includes some advanced list classes as well.
